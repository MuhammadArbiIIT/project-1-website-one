<header><h2>Origin<h2></header>
	<p>Virtual Machines were a byproduct of computers and what they were capable of achieving. To see and use this website, a person would need a computer and a internet connection. This lead to many different companies making it easy for the usser to operate their computers by making software. The software that they made was used to operate a computer with ease instead of typing in a terminal to do every command. This allowed for these companies to be catogorized as a OS software which allowed for graphical interfeces and much more.</p>

	<p>The usage of these OS softwares is that it was good only on one computer at a time making it so switching OS would be difficult. This made it hard for people that wanted to do things on Windows and MacOS at the same time as they would have to completely switch OS's instead of going through a virtual machine. Virtual machines is also another type of software that allowed the computer to run another operating system within another operating system. For example, you could be using Windows and with a virtual machine you could go to linux or a different version of windows. It is very cool to be able to switch operating systems while using another operating system all through a software, virtual machine.</p>
