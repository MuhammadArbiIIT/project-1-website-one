<header><h1>Welcome to Virtual Machines</h1></header>
<header><h2>Origin<h2></header>
	<p>Virtual Machines were a byproduct of computers and what they were capable of achieving. To see and use this website, a person would need a computer and a internet connection. This lead to many different companies making it easy for the usser to operate their computers by making software. The software that they made was used to operate a computer with ease instead of typing in a terminal to do every command. This allowed for these companies to be catogorized as a OS software which allowed for graphical interfeces and much more.</p>

<header><h2>Origin Continued<h2></header>
	<p>The usage of these OS softwares is that it was good only on one computer at a time making it so switching OS would be difficult. This made it hard for people that wanted to do things on Windows and MacOS at the same time as they would have to completely switch OS's instead of going through a virtual machine. Virtual machines is also another type of software that allowed the computer to run another operating system within another operating system. For example, you could be using Windows and with a virtual machine you could go to linux or a different version of windows. It is very cool to be able to switch operating systems while using another operating system all through a software, virtual machine.</p>

<header><h2>Use Case<h2></header>
	<p>The use case of such software can be for multitude of reasons some being to just use different softwares as one pleases or for more techinal reasons. Some of these reasons can be testing applications, viruses, old applications, and more. These are perfect uses of a virtual machine as you can simply close a virtual machine if anything were to go wrong with a virus or you can figure out which software allows a old application to still run. These uses allow a user to experiment with other OS's allowing themselves to still have a safe way of experimenting instead of jeoprodizing their own computer with precious files.</p>
