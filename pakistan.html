<header><h2>Fact 2: There are 75 spoken languages in Pakistan! <h2></header>
	<p>Having a vast population of 200 million plus people makes a country have different people speaking different languages. This is the case in Pakistan as it was once part of India and Bangladesh but it was put into its own seperate country in 1947. This resulted in many people migrating to Pakistan and speaking the languages they spoke from India or Bangladesh. This resulted in many different people knowing multiple languages as it was necessary in order for a person to communicate with another person.</p>
